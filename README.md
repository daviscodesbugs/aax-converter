# aax-converter

Convert Audible AAX files to other audio formats

## Dependencies

This package uses `ffmpeg` for file conversion; ensure that it is installed.

AAX files need to be decrypted using the activation bytes of the owner of the AAX file; you will need to know your activation bytes. [This](https://github.com/inAudible-NG/audible-activator) python script is great.
